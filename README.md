Description
------------
Would you like to have an easy solution to add an extra mainmenu item and page to your webtrees installation?
Here it is!

With this module you can set a new menu item and page. It is a simple module, without fancy extras. It is developped to quickly add a new menu item and page to webtrees, that is it. It does not provide the abbility to add submenu items or different pages per language.

Installation & upgrading
------------------------
[Download][3] and unpack the zip file and place the folder jc-simple-menu-1 in the modules_v4 folder of webtrees. Upload the newly added folder to your server. It is activated by default. Go to the control panel, click in the module section on 'Menus' where you can find the newly added menu item. You can move it up or down to change the menu order. Click on the tools icon next to the title of the newly added menu item. This will open the settings page where you can set a menu title and add the page title and text.

Extra menus and pages
---------------------
If you want to have multiple main menu items and corresponding pages, just make a copy of this module in your modules_v4 folder. Change the serial number at the end from 1 to 2 and so on. That's all you need to do. You now can set a second menu item and page. You can use this module an unlimited amount of times as long as you give each module an unique name.

Bugs and feature requests
-------------------------
This is a simple module and provided as is. If it doesn't work in your case or does not fullfill your wishes then you are simply out of luck. I do not provide any support on this module.

It is my intention to keep the module up to date with webtrees.
